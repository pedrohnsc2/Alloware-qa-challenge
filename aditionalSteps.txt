1. Automated Functional Testing:

Implement automated test suites using tools like Selenium or Cypress to test critical user pathways.
Schedule the automated tests to run at least once a day, possibly during off-peak hours.

2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline Integration:
Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that every code commit triggers a test sequence.
Use tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions for automation.

3. Regression Testing:
Develop a regression test suite to ensure new code doesn't break existing functionality.
Integrate regression tests into the daily automated test runs.

4. Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Testing:
Utilize browser testing platforms like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs to automatically test website compatibility across multiple browsers and devices.

5. Performance Testing:
Set up performance tests with tools like Apache JMeter or LoadRunner.
Monitor load time, response time, and system behavior under load daily.

6. Security Testing:
Implement automated security scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP or Nessus to detect vulnerabilities.
Perform static code analysis using tools like SonarQube to identify security risks in the codebase.

7. Monitoring and Alerting:
Use monitoring tools like New Relic or Datadog to keep track of the site's uptime and performance metrics.
Set up alerting for any anomalies or performance issues detected.

8. Usability Testing:
Collect and analyze user feedback on a daily basis through surveys and usability sessions.
Implement heat map tools like Hotjar to understand user interaction patterns.

9. Accessibility Testing:
Use automated tools like axe or Lighthouse to ensure the website remains compliant with accessibility standards like WCAG.

10. SEO Audits:
Conduct daily SEO audits using tools like SEMrush or Moz to ensure optimal search engine performance.

11. Data Integrity Checks:
Run database integrity checks to ensure transactions and data modifications are performing correctly.

12. Backup and Recovery Testing:
Regularly test backup processes and perform recovery drills to ensure data can be restored in the event of a failure.

13. Documentation and Reporting:
Document all testing processes and results.
Develop dashboards to report on test outcomes, issues found, and fixes deployed.

14. Team Reviews and Planning:
Hold daily stand-up meetings with the development and QA team to review the results from the automated tests.
Plan immediate actions for any critical issues that were discovered.

15. Continuous Improvement:
Regularly review and update test cases to reflect changes in user behavior and new features.
Stay updated with the latest testing methodologies and tools.
